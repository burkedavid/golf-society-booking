node --version

# Check if you have npm
npm --version

# Check if you have Git
git --version
```

If you don't have them:
- **Node.js**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required packages (this might take a few minutes)
npm install
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
copy .env.example .env.local
```

**Edit `.env.local` with your settings:**
```env
# For local development with PostgreSQL (recommended)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_6brHkOd1LBeR@ep-aged-queen-abbvbz3u-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"

# For local development only
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Generate a secure secret (or use the provided one for testing)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production-12345678901234567890"
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Database
```bash
# Create database tables
npm run db:push

# Seed the database with sample data and menu options
